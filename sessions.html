The workshop will focus on confidence building, self-reliance, and techniques that create open dialogue, raise tolerance and promote understanding.  The intention is to empower enough WOWs who could then offer these skills to the entire OWS community.  

We feel everyone should be empowered to stand up for themselves and protect each other from both emotional and physical harm.
