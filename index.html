					<p class='intro'>On December 18th, hundreds of folks interested in the Occupy movement will converge at Pace University to share skills and ideas. Whether you've occupied in the past or are curious about an occupied future, we think this event could be a great way to spent your time; without the threat of having to do time. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://owsoutreach.civicactions.net/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&amp;id=7">Register to Attend</a></p>

					<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Unconference">The Unconference</span></h2>
					<p class='intro'>Instead of organizing a conference where 'experts' create sessions for attendees, we've organized an unconference in which participants are empowered to organize their own sessions.</p>
					<p>Half of the sessions are the event will be organized beforehand by NYCGA Working Groups. 
					<p>The other half of the sessions will be organized during the morning sessions the day of the event.</p>

				<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="FAQ">FAQ</span></h2>
				<div class="faqlist">
					<p class='q'><b>Q: What are the costs, precisely?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: Normally, the cost for the space in question would be close to $10k for the rental. Because this is piggy backing on another conference that is using the space as well, we have a cost of $3000 for the rent. There are other costs however. Food served indoors must be purchased from the university vendor, we must pay for a certain amount of security (under negotiation), and an A/V expert from the University must be on hand. The final tally depends on how many attend. We are looking for ways to make up this difference while allowing at least 250 OWS activists at least, to attend at no cost.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: Why can’t Kitchen provide food, or allow us to provide our own security?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: The University has policies that apply to all who use the space. Some of it has to do with union contracts that would be violated if we didn’t turn to University staff.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: Who can use this space to run trainings?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: We don’t have a policy on this yet. But the goal is to prioritize trainings held by OWS operations groups, trainings that require tech (A/V equipment, wifi, computer lab), and trainings likely to meet the needs of the occupations in New York City. There are a number of methods of making these determinations, including the unconference model, pre-registration, approval of the agenda by the Communications Cluster, and by securing enough space for all OWS working group requests.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: How many people can use the training spaces?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: Right now we are contracting for ten classrooms that can be used by 500 participants. However, it is possible to expand our use of the space if we think it likely that more will attend.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: Who may attend?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: This event will be open to the public, and can be used as a recruitment vehicle to integrate new volunteers and activists into our work. However, priority will be given to current members of working groups addressing operational needs of occupations.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: Who is bottom lining this event? Who is accountable for running it in accordance with the values of OWS?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: The Tech Ops group, first of all, and secondly the Communications Cluster. This does not mean however, that training is specifically for communications related needs. We are preparing a website and public information to promote the event and make it clear how to apply for training space.</p>
					<p class='q'><b>Q: What is the relationship with Organizing 2.0 and Netroots New York?</b></p>
					<p class='a'>A: Organizing 2.0 is a collective of trainers in online organizing for unions, nonprofits and political activists. Their members are active in various OWS groups. They are running an event called Netroots New York on Dec. 17 -18. They made an offer to carve off the majority of their space on Dec. 18th for the use of the OWS movement. They approached Tech Ops, leading to this proposal. This Training Day does not carry any explicit or implicit message of support for any political organization. No one connected to this event is empowered to speak on behalf of the NYCGA or the Occupy movement.</p>
