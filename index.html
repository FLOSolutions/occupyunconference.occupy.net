          <p class='intro'>On December 18th, Netroots New York, Pace University and activists will host sessions about the Occupy movement. Whether you self-identify as an occupier or simply want to learn more about this emergent political phenomenon, we think this event will be a great way to spend you time; without the risk of doing time. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://owsoutreach.civicactions.net/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&amp;id=7">Register to Attend</a></p>

                <div class="faqlist">
                    <p class='q'><strong>Q: What are the costs, precisely?</strong></p>
                    <p class='a'>A: Normally, the cost for the space in question would be close to $10k for the rental. Because this is piggy backing on another conference that is using the space as well, we have a cost of $3000 for the rent. There are other costs, however. We must pay for a certain amount of security (under negotiation) and an A/V expert from the University must be on hand. The final tally depends on how many attend.</p>
                    <p class='q'><strong>Q: Why can't Kitchen provide food, or allow us to provide our own security?</strong></p>
                    <p class='a'>A: The University has policies that apply to all who use the space. Some of it has to do with union contracts that would be violated if we didn't turn to University staff.</p>
                    <p class='q'><strong>Q: Who can use this space to run trainings?</strong></p>
                    <p class='a'>A: We don't have a policy on this yet. But the goal is to prioritize trainings, trainings that require tech (A/V equipment, wifi, computer lab), and trainings likely to meet the needs of the occupations in New York City. There are a number of methods of making these determinations, including the unconference model, pre-registration, approval of the agenda by the Communications Cluster, and by securing enough space for all OWS working group requests.</p>
                    <p class='q'><strong>Q: How many people can use the training spaces?</strong></p>
                    <p class='a'>A: Right now we are contracting for ten classrooms that can be used by 500 participants. However, it is possible to expand our use of the space if we think it likely that more will attend.</p>
                    <p class='q'><strong>Q: Who may attend?</strong></p>
                    <p class='a'>A: This event will be open to the public, and can be used as a recruitment vehicle to integrate new volunteers and activists into our work. However, priority will be given to current members of working groups addressing operational needs of occupations.</p>
                    <p class="q"><strong>Q: What is the relationship with Organizing 2.0 and Netroots New York?</strong></p>
                    <p class="a">A: Organizing 2.0 is a collective of trainers in online organizing for unions, nonprofits and political activists. They are running an event called Netroots New York on Dec. 17 -18. This Training Day does not carry any explicit or implicit message of support for any political organization. No one connected to this event is empowered to speak on behalf of the NYCGA or the Occupy movement.</p>
